======================

Creating a SOAP server in CodeIgniter


NuSOAP server will be a controller which does not need to have its own view file, since it will only be accessed to perform certain tasks (even interact with the models if it would be necessary) and return their results via web to its remote client, so at no time it will be necessary to show the data on the screen directly from the server.
